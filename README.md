Pneumonia detection using Convolutional Neural Network.

Technologes used:
Model - MobileNetV2 (Transfer learning)
Training platform - Google Colab
Tensorflow
React.js
Flask

Dataset : Kaggle Chest X-Ray Dataset

This is a Pneumonia detection web app where the user can upload a chest X-ray and check whether they have Pneumonia.

The front end is developed using React.js
and backend using flask.

The detection of Pneumonia is done with the help of a CNN model trained with over 5000 chest X-rays.

The MobileNetV2 base model is trained to detect pneumonia from X-Rays using the principles of Transfer Learning.

The model has an accuracy of 91%.
